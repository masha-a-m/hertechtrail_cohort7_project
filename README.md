What I Learned
This project taught me valuable lessons in front-end development, user experience design, JavaScript interactivity. Through extensive research, I learnt about version control, JS functions, and project management. I also gained insights into testing, debugging, continuous learning, and basic carousal usage, ultimately enhancing my technical skills and understanding on how to work with extensive projects.
