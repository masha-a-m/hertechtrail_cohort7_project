## My Process
I started this project by learning the basics of bootstrap. After which I implemented what I was taught in class in my site. I did the HTML structure first, then moved on to basic css and added bootstrap to my HTML file. 

## Built With
HTML5 Markup
CSS Styling
Bootstrap
JavaScript


## What I Learnt
This project taught me valuable lessons in front-end development, user experience design, JavaScript interactivity. Through extensive research, I learnt about version control, JS functions, and project management. I also gained insights into testing, debugging, continuous learning, and basic carousal usage, ultimately enhancing my technical skills and understanding on how to work with extensive projects.

## Deployment
